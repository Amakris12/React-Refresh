        Name:'Curry Chicken Pot Pie',
        Time:'1 Hour and 5 minutes',
        Ingredients:"1 small onion, chopped ,2 cloves garlic, minced,1 teaspoon curry powder,¼ teaspoon salt,2 cups chopped cauliflower ,1 cup frozen peas and carrots,¼ cup all-purpose flour ,⅓ cup heavy cream, divided,2 cups low-sodium chicken broth,1 ½ cups shredded cooked chicken or turkey,1 store-bought pie crust (thawed if frozen)",
        Steps:"Step 1: Preheat oven to 400°F. Step 2: Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, curry powder and salt and cook for 1 minute. Stir in cauliflower and peas and carrots. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Set aside 1 tablespoon cream, then stir in the remaining cream, along with broth and chicken (or turkey). Step 3:  Cook, stirring often, until the mixture begins to thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan. Refrigerate, stirring occasionally, until cooled, about 10 minutes. Step 4: Spread the filling evenly. Lay pie crust over it and fold the edges under to fit the pan. Crimp the edges with a fork. Use a sharp knife to make a few slits in the crust. Brush with the reserved 1 tablespoon cream. Step 5:  Bake until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving",
